# Smart Travel Planner & Data Collection App  
### Smart India Hackathon 2025 – Problem Statement SIH25082  
**Team Name:** The Byte Club  

This project is a MERN stack + React Native based mobile application that combines **trip planning for users** with **automated, privacy-first travel data collection for government transportation planning**.

It transforms traditional manual travel surveys into a **smart, voluntary, and scalable digital system**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The application allows users to plan trips, compare transport options, and explore destinations while anonymously contributing real-time travel data to help improve national transportation infrastructure.

The platform serves **two purposes in one system**:
1. **User Benefit** – A powerful trip planning and booking assistant  
2. **Government Insight** – Real-time, anonymized travel behavior data  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional travel surveys are:
- Expensive  
- Limited in coverage  
- Infrequent  
- Often inaccurate  

This solution replaces manual surveys with **automated mobile-based data collection**, providing real-time insights into travel patterns while ensuring user privacy.

## 🔄 How It Works

### Trip Planning Interface
Users enter:
- Origin & destination  
- Travel dates  
- Number of travelers  

The app provides:
- Transport options (train, bus, flight, car, bike)
- Cost comparisons  
- Attraction and hotel recommendations  
- AI-generated itineraries  
- Google Maps route optimization  

### Automated Data Capture
With user consent:
- GPS tracks real trip routes  
- Travel chains and patterns are recorded  
- Trip purpose and companions can be added manually  

### Secure Data Sharing
- Travel data is anonymized  
- Sent securely to NATPAC servers  
- Used for transportation planning and policy decisions
